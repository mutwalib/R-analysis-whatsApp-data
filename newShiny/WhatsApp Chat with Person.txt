5/19/2018, 4:49 PM - ‪+256 780 786330‬: A girl by name Fatima went to school in the neighbouring village where she wasn't known well.

For three weeks, she came to school late and every time the teacher punished her.

On the fourth week, Fatima didn't attend school at all and many thought she had *GIVEN UP* on school due to the everyday punishment.

However, Fatima reported again on fifth week and this time she came earlier than everybody.

When the teacher came to class, Fatima was punished for not attending school the previous week but the teacher was also kind enough to commend her for coming early that day, stating that the punishments had finally yielded some results.

Just then, Fatima asked if she could say something and the teacher gave her permission.

*She started :*

_"I've been raised up by a single mother without a brother or a sister. Five weeks ago, my mother fell ill and was hospitalized. The three weeks I came late, I had to prepare something for her every morning and pass by the hospital to deliver the same. Unfortunately, mother passed away last week and that's the reason I didn't come to school. We buried her last Friday. Today I came early since I didn't have to prepare anything or even pass by the hospital. And now that she is gone, I will always be here early''_

As she sat down, no one in the whole class was able to hold their tears, the teacher was not spared either.

*Lesson:*

How many times do we judge others for things we know not? 

We ask questions like:

- When will you get married? 
- When will you have kids?
- When will you find a job? 
-When will you buy a car?
-When will you build a house?
etc.... 

Do we attempt to understand their situations or we just judge from the *case scenarios*?

Some situations are not relative and what we think could be very far from the truth. 

Don't assume you know what others go through or that people move in the same pace or direction as you

_*Life is far from that..*_

Just be kind enough to love one another as God has commanded,
 take time and kindly find out why your friend is not phoning,
why your messages are not being replied promptly,
why they haven't visited,
why they are not coming to worship,
 why someone is missing in our midst as a colleague, friend, brother or sister,
why someone is always late etc

*Be kind always.*
*Be nice to others*.

_A BLESSED WEEKEND BRETHRENS_

5/23/2018, 9:32 AM - ‪+256 759 826131‬: Successful people have two things on their lips, "smile and silence". Smile can solve a problem,  Silence can avoid problems. Sugar and salt may be mixed together but ants reject the salt and carry away only the sugar. Select the right people in life and make your life better and sweeter. If you fail to achieve your dreams, change your ways not your God. Remember, trees change their leaves and not their roots. You will never reach your destination if you stop and throw stones at every dog that barks. Haters will see you walking on water and say its because you can't swim. Even if you dance on water, your enemies will accuse you of raising dust. Make it your ambition to live a quiet life, to mind your own business and to work with your own hands. Remember, don’t ever wrestle with a pig. You’ll both get dirty, but the pig will enjoy it. -- Be Inspired and have a great day . Be kind and share.
 God is walking from door to door depositing success and good health. He has just left my home and asked me who He could go to next. I directed Him to your house. Receive His light and grace but don't keep Him in your house. Send Him to those you love and want to see succeed. ✈
